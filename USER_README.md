# User Guide: Read before using website

## User Guide
This project is a web application, nothing is required to download locally.

To access our web interface, navigate to 
https://comp333-lib-proj.vercel.app/

This page will navigate to our mock login page. At this point, we do not have communication with the Wesleyan login portal so this page is not functional. You may enter anything into the email and password field or even leave it blank. Press the login button to navigate to the home page.

The home page will show you a dropdown allowing you to select specific library rooms. Selecting a room will take you to the individual room page to see more information.

To run unit tests, click the button in the top left of the screen and they will automatically run using Mocha.

## Dangerous Site Warning
Due to the mock login screen we have created, Google flagged our project as a dangerous site attempting to steal emails and passwords. This is obviously false, we store no information entered by the user. 

It is completely safe to view our site. To skip this warning, click 'Details' then 'this unsafe site' to navigate to the login page.

This is an automatic process condicted by Google and we have submitted and appeal to get this warning removed.
