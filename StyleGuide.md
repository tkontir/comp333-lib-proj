# COMP333 (SWE) Group Project Style Guide

## Comment Style
Block comments will be made at the top of each function, prior to its declaration. These blocks will contain all of the input parameters, including name and type. They will also include a description of the expected output, including types. A brief description of the functions purpose will also be included, with examples possibly being provided if deemed necessary for best understanding. 
```js
/* add (int / float, int / float) => int / float
    This function takes in two numeric values, and returns their sum.
    add (1, 2) = 3 */
function add (a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
```
